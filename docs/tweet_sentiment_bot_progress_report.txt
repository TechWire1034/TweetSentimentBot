**Overview**
This document provides a detailed progress report for the "TweetSentimentBot" project, which began on Saturday, May 10, 2025. It outlines the development environment setup, completed tasks, challenges, and future steps. The project leverages the X API via `tweepy` to collect tweets, `transformers` for sentiment analysis, and `matplotlib` for visualization.

---

**Project Setup Recap**

1. **Development Environment**
   - **Virtual Environment**: Created a virtual environment named `venv` in `C:\Users\Unknown01\Desktop\Grok` to isolate dependencies.
     ```
     cd C:\Users\Unknown01\Desktop\Grok
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activated the environment:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Resolved global Python environment issues by reinstalling `yt-dlp 2025.4.30` and removing invalid distributions.

2. **Dependencies Installed**
   - `tweepy 4.15.0`: For X API interaction.
   - `transformers 4.51.3`: For sentiment analysis.
   - `matplotlib 3.10.3`: For data visualization.
   - `python-dotenv 1.1.0`: For securely loading the bearer token from `.env`.
   - Updated `pip` to 25.1.1 within the virtual environment.

3. **X API Configuration**
   - **App ID**: XXXXXXXX
   - **Access Level**: Basic Access (Sandbox/Development mode).
   - **Bearer Token**: Obtained and stored in `.env` file.
   - **Issue**: Encountered a `403 Forbidden` error on `/2/tweets/search/stream` endpoint due to Basic Access restrictions.
   - **Action Taken**: Contacted X Support to enable Production mode; awaiting response.

**Completed Tasks**

1. **Task 1: Tweet Collection**
   - **Objective**: Collect 50 tweets containing hashtags `#Python` or `#Coding`, excluding retweets.
   - **Method**:
     - Initially attempted streaming with `stream_tweets.py` using `/2/tweets/search/stream`, but encountered a `403 Forbidden` error.
     - Switched to polling with `search_recent_tweets` by creating `poll_tweets.py`.
   - **Script Details (`poll_tweets.py`)**:
     - Query: `#Python OR #Coding -is:retweet`.
     - Polls every 120 seconds to stay within rate limits (180 requests/15 minutes for Basic Access).
     - Handles `429 Too Many Requests` errors with a 15-minute wait and countdown timer.
     - Writes tweets to `tweets.txt` in real-time using `f.flush()`.
     - Stops after collecting 50 tweets.
   - **Outcome**:
     - Successfully collected 50 tweets by ~16:01 on May 10, 2025.
     - Tweets stored in `tweets.txt` (confirmed via Notepad).
   - **Challenges**:
     - Frequent rate limit errors (`429 Too Many Requests`) due to Basic Access limits.
     - Added a countdown timer to visually track wait times during rate limit pauses.

**Current Challenges**

1. **API Streaming Limitation**
   - **Issue**: The `403 Forbidden` error prevents use of the streaming endpoint (`/2/tweets/search/stream`) in `stream_tweets.py`.
   - **Cause**: Basic Access mode does not support streaming; Production mode is required.
   - **Status**: Awaiting X Supportâ€™s response to enable Production mode.
   - **Impact**: Currently using polling (`search_recent_tweets`) as a workaround, which is slower and hits rate limits frequently.

2. **Rate Limits**
   - **Issue**: Basic Access limits `search_recent_tweets` to 180 requests/15 minutes, causing delays (15-minute waits) during tweet collection.
   - **Mitigation**: Polling interval set to 120 seconds (~7.5 requests/15 minutes), but still hit limits due to previous API calls.
   - **Future Solution**: Production mode will increase rate limits and enable streaming.

---

**Next Steps**

1. **Immediate Action**:
   - Begin Task 3 (Sentiment Analysis) by coding a script to analyze the 50 tweets in `tweets.txt`.
   - Use `transformers` to classify sentiments and prepare data for visualization.

2. **Ongoing Monitoring**:
   - Check email, Developer Portal notifications, or X DMs for X Supportâ€™s response on Production mode.
   - If Production mode is enabled, test `stream_tweets.py` and consider switching from polling to streaming for future tweet collection.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Update this progress report with results from sentiment analysis and visualization tasks.
   - Continue referring to `TweetSentimentBot_Setup_Summary.txt` for setup details and `TweetSentimentBot_Plan.txt` for the project timeline.

**Notes**
- Always activate the virtual environment before running scripts.

**Progress Update (May 10, 2025)**:
- Updated .env file to include Hugging Face access token (HF_TOKEN) alongside existing X API bearer token (BEARER_TOKEN) to support model downloads for sentiment analysis.

**Progress Update (May 10, 2025)**:
- Ran sentiment_analysis.py, processed 171 tweets (unexpected, expected 50), with distribution {'positive': 59, 'negative': 112}.
- Verified tweets.txt had 243 lines; used deduplicate_tweets.py to clean 114 unique tweets to 50 in tweets_cleaned.txt.
- Deleted original tweets.txt, renamed tweets_cleaned.txt to tweets.txt, verified 50 lines.
- Updated sentiment_analysis.py to handle multi-line tweets and preserve hashtags, removed local_files_only=True due to tokenization error.
- Reran sentiment_analysis.py, processed 16 tweets due to parsing error, with distribution {'positive': 1, 'negative': 15}.
- Simplified sentiment_analysis.py to process each line as a tweet, processed 46 tweets with distribution {'positive': 11, 'negative': 35}.
- Switched to cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment model, processed 46 tweets with distribution {'positive': 3, 'negative': 2, 'neutral': 41}.
- Updated sentiment_analysis.py to process all 50 lines, accounting for skipped tweets.
- Reran sentiment_analysis.py, processed 50 lines (46 tweets analyzed, 4 skipped due to empty cleaned text), updated sentiment_results.txt with distribution {'positive': 3, 'negative': 2, 'neutral': 41}.

**Progress Update (May 10, 2025)**:
- Created and ran visualize_sentiment.py to generate sentiment distribution chart.
- Enhanced chart with modern dark theme, slim bars, percentage labels, and removed toolbar.
- Renamed chart title to "Sentiment Insights: #Python & #Coding Tweets" and window title to "Sentiment Analysis Chart".
- Saved sentiment_chart.png and updated README.md with chart and Figure 1 caption.
- Initialized local Git repository:
- Ran `git init` to create repository in `C:\Users\Unknown01\Desktop\Grok\.git`.
- Staged all files with `git add .` and committed with message "Add sentiment analysis demo GIF and initial project files".
- Verified with `git status`: working tree clean, on branch `master`.
