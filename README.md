  venv\Scripts\activate

- Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

  pip install -r requirements.txt

- Note: Ensure `PyQt5` is installed (`pip install PyQt5`) for visualization.
- Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following:

  BEARER_TOKEN=your_x_bearer_token
  HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token

- `BEARER_TOKEN`: Obtain from the X Developer Portal.
- `HF_TOKEN`: Obtain from Hugging Face for model access.
